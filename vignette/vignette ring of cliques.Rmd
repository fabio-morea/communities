### `make_clique`

**Title:**\
Create a Clique and Assign a Community Label

**Usage:**

``` r
make_clique(clique_size, comm_label)
```

**Arguments:**\
- `clique_size`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the
clique. All nodes will be fully connected to each other. - `comm_label`:
A numeric or character value used to assign a community label to the
nodes within the clique. The label will be stored in the `community`
node attribute.

**Value:**\
An undirected iGraph object representing a clique, where all nodes are
connected. Each node will have a `community` attribute assigned
according to the `comm_label` parameter.

**Description:**\
The `make_clique` function generates a fully connected subgraph (i.e., a
clique) of a specified size and assigns a community label to all nodes
in the clique. This function is used mainly by `make_ring_of_cliques()`.

**Details:**\
A clique is a subset of a graph where every node is connected to every
other node. This function constructs such a graph using a given number
of nodes and allows the assignment of a common community label to those
nodes. The returned graph is undirected and can be combined with other
cliques or networks.

**Examples:**

``` r
# Create a clique of size 5 with community label 1 clique <- make_clique(clique_size = 5, comm_label = 1)
```

### `make_ring_of_cliques`

**Title:**\
Create a Ring of Cliques Graph with Optional Bridge and Central Node

**Usage:**

``` r
make_ring_of_cliques(
  num_cliques,
  clique_size,
  add_center = TRUE,
  add_bridges = TRUE
)
```

**Arguments:**\
- `num_cliques`: An integer specifying the number of cliques to include
in the ring. - `clique_size`: An integer specifying the number of nodes
in each clique. - `add_center`: A logical value indicating whether to
add a central node that connects to all cliques. Default is `TRUE`. -
`add_bridges`: A logical value indicating whether to add bridge nodes
between adjacent cliques in the ring. Default is `TRUE`.

**Value:**\
An iGraph object representing the ring of cliques. Each node is assigned
a community label, with cliques labeled as `C1, C2, ...`, bridge nodes
labeled as `B1, B2, ...`, and the central node labeled as `A`. The graph
is undirected, and all edges have a weight of 1.

**Description:**\
The `make_ring_of_cliques` function generates a graph composed of
multiple fully connected subgraphs (cliques) arranged in a ring.
Optionally, "bridge nodes" can be added between cliques, and a central
node can be added that connects to all cliques.

**Details:**\
This function creates a network structure where cliques are connected in
a ring formation. Rings of cliques are useful for testing community
detection algorithms. By varying the parameters, one can create toy
examples of controlled complexity, ranging from trivially simple to
particularly challenging.\
- If `add_bridges` is `TRUE`, additional bridge nodes are inserted
between each adjacent pair of cliques, with edges connecting the
cliques. - If `add_center` is `TRUE`, a central node is added, connected
to a node in each clique, creating a star-like structure.

**Examples:**

``` r
# Create a ring of 4 cliques, each with 5 nodes, with both bridges and a central node
ring_of_cliques <- make_ring_of_cliques(num_cliques = 4, clique_size = 5, add_center = TRUE, add_bridges = TRUE)

# Create a ring of 3 cliques without bridges or a central node
ring_of_cliques_no_center <- make_ring_of_cliques(num_cliques = 3, clique_size = 4, add_center = FALSE, add_bridges = FALSE)
```
