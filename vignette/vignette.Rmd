# Benchmark networks
We start by building a simple benchmark network: a Ring of Cliques (RC) composed of 5 cliques of 6 nodes each. In such a simple case communities are easily identified by any community detection algorithm.

```{r example1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
RC_simple <- communities::make_ring_of_cliques(num_cliques = 5,
                                       clique_size = 5, 
                                       add_center = F, 
                                       add_bridges = F)
partition <- igraph::cluster_louvain(RC_simple)

plot(partition, RC_simple)


```

However, RC can be used to produce a network in which community boundaries are less clear. 

```{r example2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
RC_c <- communities::make_ring_of_cliques(num_cliques = 4,
                                       clique_size = 6, 
                                       add_center = T, 
                                       add_bridges = F)

partition <- igraph::cluster_louvain(RC_c)

node_positions <- igraph::layout.fruchterman.reingold(RC_c)
plot(partition, RC_c, layout = node_positions)

```
The central node can either belong to any of the cliques or be considered its own single-node community. This presents a challenge for both algorithms and human analysts alike, as it creates ambiguity in community assignment. Consequently, we can anticipate five equally probable solutions, where the central node is equally likely to be associated with any of the cliques.

```{r example1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#explore the solution space
sol_space <- communities::solutions_space(RC_c, 
                                          n_trials = 100,
                                          met = "LV")
sol_space <- communities::quality_check(RC_c, sol_space)

plots<-communities::plot_sol_space(sol_space)

p2<-plots$pl2+ theme(legend.position = 'none', aspect.ratio = 1)
p3<-plots$pl3+ theme(legend.position = 'none', aspect.ratio = 1)

grid.arrange(p2,p3, ncol = 2)




```

```{r}

communities::plot_all_solutions(RC_c, sol_space)   
 
```


## input ordering bias
In the example above, the network was shuffled before each run of the community detection algorithm to help mitigate input ordering bias. To highlight the importance of this, we can repeat the experiment with the 'shuffle' parameter set to FALSE. In this case, community detection will be performed on the network exactly as it was provided, which is influenced by the order in which nodes and edges are sorted in the original data. Although in theory this should not impact the results (since graphs are inherently unordered mathematical objects), it does. This is because the software representation of networks is inherently orderedâ€”whether in the form of a list, array, dataset, or other sequential data structure.


```{r example1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#explore the solution space
sol_space_biased <- communities::solutions_space(RC_c, 
                                          n_trials = 100,
                                          met = "LV", 
                                          shuffle = FALSE)
#add quality check 
sol_space_biased <- communities::quality_check(RC_c, sol_space_biased)

#plot
plots_biased <- plot_sol_space(sol_space_biased)

p2b<-plots_biased$pl2+theme(legend.position = 'none')
p3b<-plots_biased$pl3+theme(legend.position = 'none')

communities::plot_all_solutions(RC_c, sol_space_biased) 

grid.arrange(p2b,p3b, ncol = 2)


```
In this case, only three distinct solutions were found, with one being significantly more frequent than the others. The ring of cliques represents an extreme case that clearly illustrates this issue. However, input ordering bias can occur with any network, not just in this specific example. For this reason, the shuffle parameter is set to TRUE by default, ensuring that the results are less dependent on the original input order.

# consensus community detection on unbiased solutions
```{r}

sol_space <- communities::solutions_space(RC_c, 
                                          n_trials = 100,
                                          met = "LV")
sol_space <- communities::quality_check(RC_c, sol_space)
 
D <- communities::co_occurrence(sol_space)
 
        
comms <- communities::consensus_communities(D, p =.8)
        
        #aggregate singletons in community 0
        #comms$community[ comms$community_size == 1] <- 0
        #
  
        
nc <- max(comms$cons_comm_label)
V(RC_c)$community <- comms$cons_comm_label
V(RC_c)$gamma <- comms$gamma %>% round(2)

node_positions <- igraph::layout.fruchterman.reingold(RC_c)


par(mfrow = c(1,2),  # Grid layout
        mar = c(1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0),  #  inner margins: bottom, left, top, right
        oma = c(0, 1.0, 0, 1.00))          #  outer margins: bottom, left, top, right

plot(RC_c, 
     layout = node_positions,
     vertex.size = 30,
     vertex.color = "white",
     vertex.label = paste("C",V(RC_c)$community),
     vertex.label.cex = 0.5,   
     vertex.label.color = "black",  
     vertex.label.family = "sans",  
     mark.groups = split(1:vcount(RC_c), V(RC_c)$community ),          
     mark.col = rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, alpha = 0.1),   
     mark.border = 'red',              
     main = "membership"
     )
     

plot(RC_c, 
     layout = node_positions,
     vertex.size = 30,
     vertex.label = V(RC_c)$gamma ,
     vertex.label.cex = 0.5,   
     vertex.label.color = "black",  
     vertex.label.family = "sans",  
     vertex.color = if_else(V(RC_c)$gamma > 0.5, "yellow", "lightgreen"),
     mark.groups = split(1:vcount(RC_c), V(RC_c)$community ),          
     mark.col = rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, alpha = 0.1),   
     mark.border = 'red',              
     main = "uncertainty"
     )
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1, oma = c(0,0,0,0))

# testing solution space params
In this case we set a maximum number of trials at 500, and tau = 0.90 ie we want to stop searching for new solutions when the probability of a stable solution space is .90

```{r}
sol_space <- communities::solutions_space(RC_c, 
                                          n_trials = 500,
                                          tau = 0.9,
                                          met = "LV")
logdata<-sol_space$log
last <- logdata %>% tail(1) 
t = last$a + last$b -2
ns = last$s
p_stable = (t-ns)/(t+1)
p_stable
```
something different occurs when there are multiple solutions
If we set tmax = 100, the probability of a complete solution space is low, around 0.75
set higher tmax and exit when p = 0.90
ie at t = 210

```{r}

RC_cb <- communities::make_ring_of_cliques(num_cliques = 5,
                                       clique_size = 5, 
                                       add_center = T, 
                                       add_bridges = T)

plot(RC_cb)

sol_space <- communities::solutions_space(RC_cb, 
                                          n_trials = 200,
                                          tau = 0.9,
                                          met = "LV")

logdata<-sol_space$log
last <- logdata %>% tail(1) 
t = last$a + last$b -2
ns = last$s
p_stable = (t-ns)/(t+1)
p_stable

sol_space <- quality_check(RC_cb, sol_space )
plot_sol_space(sol_space )
```
