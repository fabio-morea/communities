# communities

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The purpose of the "communities" module is to offer supplementary
functions for community detection in networks, building on the R-igraph
library. It introduces several novel functions to:

-   Generate a family of toy networks suitable for testing community
    detection algorithms

-   Produce interpretable community labels

-   Explore the solution space of community detection

-   Enhance the quality assessment of the solution space

-   Offer additional visualization options.

## Installation

You can install the development version of communities from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("fabio-morea/communities")
```

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(communities) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? -->
<!-- You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` -->
<!-- up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure -->
<!-- files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
