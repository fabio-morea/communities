\title{Similarity Matrix Between Community Partitions (NMI)}
\usage{
similarity_matrix_nmi(partitions)
}
\arguments{
\item{partitions}{A tibble, data.frame, or matrix with \eqn{n} rows (nodes)
and \eqn{k} columns (solutions). Each column contains community labels for
one partitioning of the same graph.}
}
\value{
A \eqn{k \times k} symmetric numeric matrix with values in [0, 1]:
\itemize{
\item \code{1} = identical partitions,
\item \code{0} = completely dissimilar partitions.
}
Row and column names correspond to the input column names (or
\code{"sol1"}, \code{"sol2"}, â€¦ if missing).
}
\description{
Computes a pairwise similarity matrix between community-detection solutions
using Normalized Mutual Information (NMI, square-root normalization).
The measure is invariant to community label permutations.
}
\details{
This function calls \code{\link[aricode]{NMI}} from the \pkg{aricode} package
with \code{variant = "sqrt"}, which ensures values are in [0, 1].
The diagonal is always set to \code{1}.
