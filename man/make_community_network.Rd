\title{Build a Community Network from an iGraph Object}
\usage{
make_community_network(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object representing the original network. Required attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{V(g)$community}: Integer vector of community assignments
\item \code{E(g)$weight}: Numeric vector of edge weights (use 1.0 for unweighted)
}}
}
\value{
An igraph object representing the community network with attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{V(gc)$id}: Community identifiers
\item \code{V(gc)$size}: Number of nodes in each community
\item \code{E(gc)$weight}: Aggregated edge weights between communities
}
}
\description{
Constructs a meta-network where each node represents a community from the
original network. Edges between communities represent aggregated connections
between nodes in those communities.
}
\details{
Aggregates nodes and edges by community membership to create a
higher-level representation of network structure.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(igraph)
g <- make_ring(10)
V(g)$community <- rep(1:2, each = 5)
E(g)$weight <- 1.0
gc <- make_community_network(g)
}
