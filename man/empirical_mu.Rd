\title{Calculate the Empirical Mixing Parameter (Mu)}
\usage{
empirical_mu(graph, community_labels)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph object representing the network. Edge weights will be
set to 1.0 if not present.}

\item{community_labels}{A vector of community labels, ordered according to
the vertices in \code{graph}. These labels define the community membership
of each node.}
}
\value{
A numeric value in \link{0, 1} representing the empirical mixing parameter
(μ), which is the ratio of inter-community edge weights to total edge weights.
Higher values indicate more mixing between communities.
}
\description{
Calculates the mixing parameter μ (mu) for a given network, which represents
the proportion of edges that connect nodes from different communities. This
parameter quantifies how mixed or modular a network is.
}
\details{
The function ensures all edges have weights (defaulting to 1.0 if missing),
then calculates the proportion of edge weight that connects nodes from
different communities relative to the total edge weight in the graph.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(igraph)
graph <- make_ring_of_cliques(3, 5)
community_labels <- V(graph)$gt_community
mu <- empirical_mu(graph, community_labels)
print(mu)
}
