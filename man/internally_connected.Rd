\title{Calculate the Number of Connected Components within Each Community}
\usage{
internally_connected(graph, community_labels)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph object representing the network to be analyzed.}

\item{community_labels}{A vector of community labels, where each label
corresponds to a node in the graph. The length of this vector must match
the number of vertices in the graph.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector where each element corresponds to the number of
connected components in one of the communities. The order matches the
order of unique community labels in the input.
}
\description{
Calculates how many connected components exist within each community of a
given network. For each community, it extracts the induced subgraph and
computes the number of connected components.
}
\details{
The function assigns community labels to vertices, then for each community,
extracts the induced subgraph and counts connected components. A community
is internally connected if it has exactly one connected component.

library(igraph)
graph <- make_ring_of_cliques(4, 5)
community_labels <- V(graph)$gt_community
internal_components <- internally_connected(graph, community_labels)
print(internal_components)
