\title{Assign Community Labels Based on the Strongest Node in Each Community}
\usage{
comm_label_as_strongest(graph, community_membership)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph object representing the network. The graph should have
weights for the edges if node strength is to be calculated based on weighted
degrees.}

\item{community_membership}{A community detection object (such as from
\code{cluster_*} functions in the igraph package) that contains membership
information, mapping each node to its community.}
}
\value{
A vector of community labels, where each node is assigned the label
of the strongest node in its community. The labels take the form
\code{"C_<node_name>"}, where \code{<node_name>} is the name of the
strongest node in that community.
}
\description{
Typically, community labels generated from community detection algorithms are
arbitrary and unrelated to node identifiers. In some cases, it can be useful
to assign more meaningful labels to communities that are easier to interpret.
A practical choice is to label the community after its "strongest" node, i.e.,
the node with the highest strength (the sum of the weights of its connections).
This approach provides a label that reflects the most central or influential
node within each community, making the labels more interpretable.
}
\details{
With \code{comm_label_as_strongest}, each community is labeled with the identifier
of its strongest node.

The function works by calculating the node strength (the sum of weights of
adjacent edges) for all nodes in the graph. For each community, the node with
the highest strength is identified, and that node's name is used as the label
for the entire community. This labeling helps to identify and label communities
based on the most influential node within them.

# Create a simple graph
