\title{Plot the Solution Space of Community Detection Results}
\usage{
plot_sol_space(sol_space)
}
\arguments{
\item{sol_space}{A dataframe produced by the \code{explore_solution_space} function. The dataframe should contain
data on community partitions and relevant statistics such as cumulative sums, medians, and upper/lower bounds
for each solution.}
}
\value{
A list of up to 4 plots:
\itemize{
\item \code{pl1}: A line plot showing the cumulative sum and median of solutions, with error bars indicating variability.
\item \code{pl2}: A visualization of the solution space, showing the range of valid and non-valid solutions.
\item \code{pl3}: A scatter plot showing the distribution of community sizes for each solution.
\item \code{pl4}: A plot representing the similarity between the solutions (empty if solution space contains only one solution).
}
}
\description{
The \code{plot_sol_space} function generates a series of plots to visually explore the solution space
derived from community detection analysis. It provides insights into the distribution of solutions,
their internal consistency, and similarities between different partitions.

\examples{
# Assuming 'sol_space' is a dataframe produced by 'explore_solution_space'
plot_list <- plot_sol_space(sol_space)
