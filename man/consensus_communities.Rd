\title{Identify Consensus Communities from Co-occurrence Matrix}
\usage{
consensus_communities(
  co_occurrence_matrix,
  co_occurrence_threshold,
  group_outliers = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{co_occurrence_matrix}{A symmetric co-occurrence matrix where entries
represent pairwise co-occurrence probabilities across multiple trials.}

\item{co_occurrence_threshold}{Numeric threshold for defining communities.
Nodes are considered in the same community if their pairwise co-occurrence
exceeds this value.}

\item{group_outliers}{Logical indicating whether single-node communities
(outliers) should be grouped together (default: FALSE).}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print progress information
(default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{node_name}}{Name of each node}
\item{\code{consensus_community_label}}{Consensus community assignment}
\item{\code{uncertainty_coefficient}}{Confidence measure (gamma) for assignment}
\item{\code{community_size}}{Size of assigned community}
\item{\code{is_singleton}}{Whether node forms single-node community}
}
}
\description{
Identifies consensus communities from a co-occurrence matrix by grouping nodes
based on a threshold for pairwise co-occurrence. Computes uncertainty coefficients
reflecting confidence in community assignments.
}
\details{
The algorithm iteratively identifies communities as connected components in
the thresholded co-occurrence matrix. The uncertainty coefficient gamma is
computed as 1 - mean(co-occurrence values) for nodes that co-occur at least
once with the focal node.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume co_occurrence_matrix is a co-occurrence matrix
consensus_result <- consensus_communities(
  co_occurrence_matrix, 
  co_occurrence_threshold = 0.5, 
  group_outliers = TRUE
)
print(consensus_result)
