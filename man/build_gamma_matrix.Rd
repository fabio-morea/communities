\title{Build Pairwise Agreement Matrix (Gamma) from Solution Space}
\usage{
build_gamma_matrix(
  partitions,
  solution_probabilities = NULL,
  tolerance = 1e-09
)
}
\arguments{
\item{partitions}{Matrix (n_vertices × n_solutions) of community assignments,
OR a vector (length n_vertices) for single-partition case.}

\item{solution_probabilities}{Optional numeric vector of length n_solutions
with non-negative weights that sum to 1. Defaults to equal weights.}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric tolerance for probability sum validation (default: 1e-9).}
}
\value{
An n_vertices × n_vertices symmetric matrix with entries in \link{0, 1}
and unit diagonal.
}
\description{
Computes the pairwise agreement matrix Gamma where entry (u,v) represents
the probability that nodes u and v are assigned to the same community,
weighted by solution probabilities.
}
\details{
The agreement matrix is computed as: Gamma\link{u,v} = sum_i p\link{i} * I(u and v
co-occur in partition i), where I is the indicator function and p\link{i} is
the probability of partition i.
}
\examples{
# Multi-partition example
partition_matrix <- cbind(
  c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2),  # partition 1
  c(1, 2, 2, 2, 2)   # partition 2
)
gamma_matrix <- build_gamma_matrix(partition_matrix, solution_probabilities = c(0.6, 0.4))
