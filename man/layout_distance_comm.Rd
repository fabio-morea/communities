\title{Calculate Distances for Community-Based Network Layout}
\usage{
layout_distance_comm(g, membership, eps = 0.02)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object with edge weights stored in \code{E(g)$weight}.
For unweighted graphs, set all weights to 1.0.}

\item{membership}{Numeric vector of community assignments, one per node,
ordered as \code{V(g)}.}

\item{eps}{Numeric. Minimum distance between nodes in the same community.
Default is 0.02. Typical values: 0.1 to 0.2.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of distances, one per edge in \code{E(g)}, ordered
according to the edge list.
}
\description{
Computes edge distances that pull nodes in the same community closer together
while pushing nodes in different communities farther apart. Useful for layout
algorithms that accept distance matrices.
}
\details{
Distance formula for edge \eqn{(u,v)}:
\deqn{d_{uv} = \epsilon + (1 - \epsilon) \cdot w_{uv} \cdot I(c_u = c_v)}
where \eqn{I(\cdot)} is the indicator function and \eqn{w_{uv}} is the
edge weight.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
g <- make_ring(10)
E(g)$weight <- runif(ecount(g))
membership <- rep(1:2, each = 5)
distances <- layout_distance_comm(g, membership, eps = 0.15)
}
