\title{Calculate Co-occurrence Matrix from Solution Space}
\usage{
co_occurrence(solution_space_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{solution_space_result}{A list from \code{solutions_space_DM()} containing
\code{partitions} (matrix of community assignments) and \code{probabilities}
(data frame with solution weights).}
}
\value{
A symmetric n_vertices Ã— n_vertices matrix with entries in \link{0, 1}
and unit diagonal, showing co-occurrence probabilities.
}
\description{
Computes a weighted co-occurrence matrix indicating how often pairs of nodes
appear together in the same community across different solutions, weighted
by solution probabilities.
}
\details{
The co-occurrence matrix D\link{u,v} represents the probability that nodes u and v
are assigned to the same community, weighted by the posterior probabilities
of each solution. The diagonal is always 1 (each node co-occurs with itself).

graph <- make_ring_of_cliques(4, 5)
solution_space_result <- solutions_space_DM(graph, n_trials = 50)

}
